  <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>

  <p>
    This privacy policy applies to the <strong>Photo Exchange</strong> app for mobile devices,
    which was created by <strong>Y-Yes Lab</strong> as a free service.
  </p>

  <h2>Information Collection and Use</h2>

  <p>The Application only uses the following permissions in order to provide its core functionality:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Camera access:</strong> to allow you to take pictures for text recognition.</li>
    <li><strong>Photo library / storage access:</strong> to allow you to select existing photos from your device for text recognition.</li>
    <li><strong>Network access:</strong> to retrieve exchange rates from a secure public API over HTTPS.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    The Application does not collect precise location data, personal identifiers, or any other sensitive personal information.
    No data is shared with third parties for advertising or marketing purposes.
  </p>

  <h2>Third Party Access</h2>

  <p>
    The Application does not transmit your photos or personal data to any external parties.
    Photos are processed locally on your device for OCR (text recognition) only.
    Only currency codes (e.g., USD, MYR) are sent securely to the backend API for exchange rate calculation.
  </p>

  <p>The Service Provider does not sell or share your information with any third parties.</p>

  <h2>Data Retention and Deletion</h2>

  <p>
    The Application does not store any user data permanently.
    Photos you take or select are only used temporarily for OCR processing on your device and are never uploaded or retained.
    You may delete the app at any time to remove all local data.
  </p>

  <h2>Security Practices</h2>

  <p>
    All network requests are transmitted securely over HTTPS.
    The Application only requests the minimal permissions required (camera, storage, internet).
  </p>

  <h2>Changes</h2>

  <p>
    This Privacy Policy may be updated from time to time for any reason.
    Any updates will be posted
