Privacy Policy

This privacy policy applies to the Photo Exchange app for mobile devices that was created by Y-Yes Lab as a Free service.

Information Collection and Use

The Application only uses the following permissions in order to provide its core functionality:

- Camera access: to allow you to take pictures for text recognition.
- Photo library / storage access: to allow you to select existing photos from your device.
- Network access: to connect to the backend API over HTTPS in order to retrieve exchange rates.

The Application does not collect precise location data, personal identifiers, or any other sensitive personal information.  
No data is shared with third parties for advertising or marketing purposes.

Third Party Access

The Application does not transmit your photos or personal data to any external parties.  
- Photos are only processed locally on your device for OCR (text recognition).  
- Only currency codes (e.g., USD, MYR) are sent securely to the backend API for exchange rate calculation.  

The Service Provider does not sell or share your information with third parties.

Data Retention and Deletion

The Application does not store any user data permanently.  
Photos you take or select are only used temporarily for OCR on your device and are not uploaded or retained.  
You can delete the app at any time to remove all local data.

---

Security Practices

All network requests are transmitted over HTTPS.  
The Application only requests the minimal permissions required (camera, storage, internet).

---

Changes

This Privacy Policy may be updated from time to time for any reason.  
Any changes will be posted here. Continued use of the Application after changes are made will be deemed acceptance of those changes.
